CANONKEYS PCB WILL FIT

[Credits]
Credits to Elaine for allowing me to make it open source and inspiration (consider supporting Elaine. If you have an opportunity to get a unikorn, I suggest you do so)
since this keyboard here doesn't use the unikorn pcb, it is not considered to be a full clone of the keybaord

Credits to kkatano for the bakeneko keyboard

I modified the side profiles of the case to be more like a unikorn

[People to contact for manufacturing]
You can contact these people to manufacture the keyboard case and backplate: nash.goajie on discord https://www.instagram.com/wu.zamol/ and gjhelen on discord if you are willing to pay the price of Al6063-T6 then i suggest you go with that for the case since it's what most endgame kb level use, if you want it to be budget level polycarbonate case or 6061 case. For People in the US, you can go with Rikkachet#2267 on discord to manufacture the kb though they might charge more than the chinese manufactures
